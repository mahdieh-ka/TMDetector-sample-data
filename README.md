# TMDetector Overview
TMDetector data is a versatile annotated dataset of transport modes collected by mobile users. This dataset is gathered using the TMDetector collection module. TMDetector collects this ground truth data from three different sensors accelerometer magnetometer and GPS with various sampling rates. 
Data collection is carried out across four distinct cities: Oslo, Rome, Stockholm, and Tehran utilizing TMDeetctor to capture a wide range of transport modes, road conditions, and related patterns across the urban areas of these cities. 
Data collection within all cities involved 10 various users using different smartphone models, including Sony Xperia XZ2 Compact, Sony Xperia XZS, Samsung Galaxy S21, Motorola Nexus 6, Xiaomi Poco F3, Xiaomi Mi Mix 3, Google Pixel 5a, Xiaomi Mi 10 5G, Samsung Galaxy S10, and Motorola Moto G20. The smartphones used vary in age from 1 to 9 years and run on Android versions ranging from 7 to 13. This diversity covers a broad range of both Android versions and device ages. 
Users carried their smartphones in diverse positions such as bags, backpacks, front or back pockets, etc., with instructions to avoid shaking their smartphones to prevent unwanted noise.
